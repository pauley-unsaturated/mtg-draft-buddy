"""Stop-the-world guardrail (PLAN §0): the current sandbagged set must never
enter any pretraining corpus, warm-start source, or scaler-fit source.

History: MSH was the sandbag from project start until 2026-07-29, when the
Phase-3 gate passed (owner ruling, see journal) and it joined the corpus in
pretrain_v2. pretrain_v1 is frozen as EXP-030's training manifest and must keep
its MSH quarantine for provenance. The next Arena release becomes the new
sandbag: add its code to the LATEST manifest's `quarantine` on announcement day
— test_latest_manifest_has_sandbag will remind us it is empty until then.
