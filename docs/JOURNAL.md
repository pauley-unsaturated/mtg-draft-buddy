## 2026-07-28 — Session start: enacting docs/PLAN.md from P0.T1

Owner directive for this session (Mark): deliver BOTH tryable models — (1) the modernized
single-set model trained on MSH only (Phase 2), and (2) the pretrained/general model
fine-tuned on MSH (Phase 3). Target set is MSH (confirmed; it is the currently
available Arena set). Additional owner requirement: **validate that models agree with
good drafters, not bad drafters** — implemented as a first-class eval metric: the
scorecard reports top-1 agreement on the expert subset (WR ≥ 0.62, ≥ 100 games) AND on
a low-skill subset (bottom tail by user_win_rate), plus the gap. A model that mimics
skilled play must show expert-agreement > low-skill-agreement; the gap must not be
worse than GIH-greedy's. Added to P1.T2 scope (journal-sanctioned scope addition, no
plan tasks reordered).

Environment: uv 0.11.19 present, system python 3.14 (project pins 3.12 via uv).
Starting P0.T1 scaffolding.

## 2026-07-28 — 17lands ratings-API drift; backlog item promoted into P0.T6

The anonymous `card_ratings/data` API no longer serves win rates (all null) and
ignores `start_date`/`end_date` (verified on MSH, FIN, EOE, TDM; counts also ~100×
too small). This breaks the original stats pathway recorded in PLAN Appendix B.
Remedy: promoted the backlog item **"rating-free stat features derived from raw
game_data"** into P0.T6. Snapshots are now computed from the public
`game_data_public.<SET>.<EVENT>.csv.gz` + our converted draft parquet:
ALSA/ATA/seen/pick counts from draft data; GP/OH/GD/GIH/GNS win rates + IWD from
game data, overall + all 31 exact-deck-color filters; win rates NaN (masked) under
5 games. Date windows are exact (game_time date ∈ [start, end]), which makes the
week-1 "day-7 knowledge" snapshots *more* honest than the API ever was. The two
API-fetched snapshot files (null win rates, useless) were deleted and rebuilt via
`features.build_snapshot`; on-disk contract unchanged. Note for future sets:
game_data must be fetched alongside draft_data (fetch.py now takes kind="game").
